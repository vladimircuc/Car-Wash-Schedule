Welcome to my car wash schedule program in JAVA.    
This program uses Linked List based Stacks and Queues to keep track of how cars get into a car wash, how long they wait in line and if there is still space for the car in the queue      
The program saves all the customers that are supposed to come in the current day in a linked-list based queue named OutLine. They have an arrival time, ID and name and a code representing the services wanted.     
When they arrive, if there is space in the InLine queue they step in the queue and wait to be served if another customer is already being served        
They also receive a cupon with a code representing the services they want (wash, wax and vacuum). They can choose one two or 3 services       
When a car starts being served they put their ticket in a stack of ticktes       
There is also a lowly minion that once in a while collects all the tickets from the stacks of tickets starting with the last one entered, just like from a normal stack and prints them    
The lowly minion is known to have the Z code as a client and does not ocupy a place in line    
At 4PM when the car wash closes, the lowly minion collects all tickets from the stack and prints them            
Best way to see this program in action is trying the input sample commands from the input sample file and see exactly how it works.       
Have fun :))
